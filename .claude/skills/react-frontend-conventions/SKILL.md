description: "Constrains functional React with TypeScript and Tailwind: local state colocation, explicit props instead of spreads, Context for cross-cutting state, useMemo for heavy derivations, use-prefixed hooks, component tests. Do not use for class components, styled-components, or non-Tailwind styling stacks."

# React frontend conventions

## Procedures

**When building or auditing React UI**

1. Implement components as functions only; reject class components.
2. Author components as TypeScript in `.tsx` files.
3. Keep component state colocated nearest to consumers rather than centralized by default.
4. Pass props explicitly between parents and children; avoid spreading arbitrary prop bags into DOM or leaf components (`{...props}` on shared primitives is disallowed unless a documented exception exists).
5. Split components that exceed roughly 100 lines into smaller cohesive units rather than increasing file size indefinitely.
6. Apply Context API where multiple distinct subtrees consume the same cross-cutting UI state without prop drilling overload.
7. Style with Tailwind utility classes instead of styled-components or CSS-in-JS libraries in this codebase.
8. Avoid excessive fragmentation into tiny wrapper components lacking clear abstraction value.
9. Wrap expensive derivations dependent on arrays or heavy objects with `useMemo` and precise dependency arrays.
10. Name custom hooks with the `use` prefix (`useAuth`, `useLocalStorage`, `useUrl`).
11. Before introducing a sizeable bespoke component library, investigate existing shared components and confirm whether reuse is mandated.
12. Add automated tests for every component surfaced to users or shared across features.
13. Prefer composing existing primitives and feature modules before authoring net-new equivalents; escalate ambiguous duplication through design review paths.

## Error Handling

1. When Tailwind gaps block layout parity, reconcile with shared `components/ui` primitives before layering ad hoc inline styles.
2. When prop drilling depth suggests Context misuse, refactor boundaries so providers wrap coherent subtrees rather than the entire router tree without reason.
