# Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript conventions

## Procedures

**When writing or modifying application TypeScript**

1. Author runtime and shared source strictly in TypeScript.
2. Use npm exclusively for installs and script execution (`npm install`, `npm run build`). Do not introduce alternate package managers for those roles.
3. When libraries omit types, prefer `@types/<package>` where published on DefinitelyTyped; rely on bundled types when shipped (Vitest includes types).
4. Before finishing edits, validate type correctness via the project toolchain (`npm run build` / `tsc` / editor diagnostics as applicable).
5. Prefer `const` bindings; reserve `let` for genuine reassignment and never declare with `var`.
6. Declare class fields `private`, `readonly`, or both unless a deliberate public surface is mandated by the dependency graph.
7. Prefer immutable chain helpers (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `find`) over manual `for` / `while` loops for collection transforms.
8. Prefer arrow functions for short pure operations and lexical `this` where stylistically consistent with surrounding modules.
9. Sequence asynchronous operations with `async` / `await` instead of chaining bare `.then` trees for primary control flow.
10. Ban `any`; supply concrete interfaces or type aliases covering inputs and outputs.
11. Replace CommonJS imports with ESM syntax (`import` / `export`); disallow `require` and `module.exports` in TypeScript modules.
12. Export a single default when the module exposes exactly one principal symbol; otherwise use named exports with consistent barrel ergonomics.

## Error Handling

1. When `async` awaits risk unhandled rejection, propagate errors to callers or map them to domain-safe results following service-layer norms.
2. When dependency scripts assume another package manager, align documentation and CI to npm-first flows before branching tooling.
